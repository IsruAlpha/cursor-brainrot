The tool will monitor Cursor AI's output and automatically open relevant video platforms based on keywords and detected content.

⚙️ How It Works

cursor-brainrot hooks into the output stream of Cursor AI and scans the responses for triggers related to TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and X videos.
When a trigger is detected, it opens a new Chrome browser window with the corresponding video platform, allowing for instant access to trending content.
