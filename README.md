## 🚀 About

`cursor-brainrot` is a fun and powerful CLI tool inspired by [Claude Brainrot](https://github.com/unoptimal/claude-brainrot).  
It listens to **Cursor AI** responses and automatically launches popular short-video platforms such as:

- TikTok  
- Instagram Reels  
- YouTube Shorts  
- X (formerly Twitter)

Each platform opens in its own separate Chrome window — making it easy and seamless to binge trending content while interacting with Cursor AI.

## ✨ Features

- Automatically opens TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and X based on AI output  
- Opens each platform in a new Chrome window for focused browsing  
- Lightweight, simple CLI experience  
- Works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)  

---

## 💻 Installation

Install **globally** via npm:

```bash
npm install -g cursor-brainrot
Or, run without installing using npx:

bash
Copy code
npx cursor-brainrot
🎯 Usage
Simply run from your terminal:

bash
Copy code
cursor-brainrot
The tool will monitor Cursor AI's output and automatically open relevant video platforms based on keywords and detected content.

⚙️ How It Works
cursor-brainrot hooks into the output stream of Cursor AI and scans the responses for triggers related to TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and X videos.
When a trigger is detected, it opens a new Chrome browser window with the corresponding video platform, allowing for instant access to trending content.
